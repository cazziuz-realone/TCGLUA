- **Status:** ✅ Framework implemented (~15.8KB)

#### 4. Card Database (`scripts/data/card_database.lua`)
- **Purpose:** Card definitions and management
- **Key Features:**
  - Card storage and retrieval
  - Card type definitions
  - Database loading system
- **Status:** ✅ Database framework implemented (~14.9KB)

#### 5. Entity Systems
- **Player Module:** Player state, mana, health, deck management
- **Deck Module:** Deck creation, shuffling, card management
- **Card Entities:** Individual card logic and properties
- **Status:** ✅ Core entities implemented

#### 6. Scene Management (`scripts/ui/scene_manager.lua`)
- **Purpose:** UI scene transitions and management
- **Key Features:**
  - Scene loading/unloading
  - Input handling delegation
  - Scene state management
- **Status:** ✅ Framework implemented

#### 7. Input System (`scripts/input/input_manager.lua`)
- **Purpose:** Centralized input handling
- **Key Features:**
  - Input event processing
  - Action mapping
  - Input delegation to appropriate systems
- **Status:** ✅ Framework implemented

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Systems
- Project structure and organization
- Core game loop and state management
- Turn-based gameplay mechanics
- AI player framework
- Card database system
- Scene management
- Input handling
- Entity management (Player, Deck)
- Logging system
- Game event tracking

### 🔄 Partially Implemented
- **Card Implementations:** Framework exists but card content needs population
- **GUI Components:** Framework exists but visual implementation pending
- **Audio System:** Placeholder in game controller
- **Save/Load System:** Placeholder in game controller

### ❌ Not Yet Implemented
- Actual card content and balancing
- Visual assets and graphics
- Audio assets and music
- Save/load functionality
- Deck builder UI implementation
- Game setup UI implementation
- Gameplay UI implementation
- Menu systems
- Settings management
- Player progression system

## Technical Notes

### Development Environment
- **Engine:** Defold (Lua-based game engine)
- **Language:** Lua
- **Platform:** Cross-platform (Defold supports multiple platforms)
- **Architecture:** Component-based with modular design

### Code Quality
- Well-structured modular architecture
- Comprehensive logging system
- Event-driven design
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions

### Performance Considerations
- Lightweight Lua implementation
- Event-based system reduces polling overhead
- Modular loading reduces memory footprint
- Defold's optimized engine handling

## Next Development Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Card Content Creation:** Populate card database with actual game cards
2. **GUI Implementation:** Create visual interfaces for all game scenes
3. **Asset Integration:** Add graphics, animations, and audio
4. **Game Balance:** Tune gameplay mechanics and card abilities

### Medium Priority
1. **Save/Load System:** Implement persistent game data
2. **Settings System:** Add game configuration options
3. **Tutorial System:** Create new player onboarding
4. **Multiplayer Foundation:** Prepare architecture for network play

### Low Priority
1. **Advanced AI:** Improve AI decision-making algorithms
2. **Player Progression:** Add unlockable content
3. **Analytics:** Add player behavior tracking
4. **Platform Optimization:** Optimize for specific platforms

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing modular structure
- Use comprehensive logging for debugging
- Maintain separation between game logic and presentation
- Document new modules and functions
- Follow Lua and Defold best practices

### Testing Approach
- Test core game mechanics thoroughly
- Validate AI behavior across difficulty levels
- Ensure proper scene transitions
- Test input handling across different scenarios
- Validate game state consistency

## Known Issues & Technical Debt
- Card deck creation functions return empty decks (need content)
- Audio and save systems are placeholder implementations
- GUI scenes referenced but not yet implemented
- Need asset pipeline for graphics and audio
- AI evaluation functions need refinement
